# Zeffiros-Kitchen
This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap being used as the design framework. This was the final project for the Web Design Fundamentals course I took while studying IT Web Development at NSCC. The purpose of this project was to take a series of PSD mockups that were sent to me by the instructor on how to build the Zeffiro's website, and build a website using Bootstrap that resembles the PSD mockups as closely as possible.
